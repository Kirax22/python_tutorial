# print(type(s_from_list))

# method to add a items in set
# s = set()
# s.add(1) 
# print(s)



# if else statement

# var1 = 3
# var2 = 5 
# var3 = input()

# if var3>var2:

# Exercise 2 - Faulty Calculator
# 45 * 3 = 555, 56+9 = 77, 56/6 = 4
# Design a calculator which will correctly solve all the problems except
# the following ones:
# 45 * 3 = 555, 56+9 = 77, 56/6 = 4
# Your program should take operator  and the two numbers as input from the user
# and then return the result
